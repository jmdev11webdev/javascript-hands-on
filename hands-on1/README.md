This repository contains a series of exercises designed to strengthen your understanding of conditional logic in JavaScript.

## 🟢 Challenge 1 — Number Checker (Very Easy)

### 🎯 Goal
Practice basic comparison logic using `if`, `else if`, and `else` statements.

### 📋 Requirements
1. **Declare** a variable called `number`.
2. **Evaluate** the value:
   - If the number is **greater than 0** $\rightarrow$ log `"Positive"`
   - If the number is **equal to 0** $\rightarrow$ log `"Zero"`
   - If the number is **less than 0** $\rightarrow$ log `"Negative"`

### 💡 Think About
* **Operators:** Which comparison operators (`>`, `<`, `===`) are most appropriate?
* **Flow:** What is the most logical order for these conditions to be checked?
* **Edge Cases:** What happens if the input is not a number? (Optional)

### 🚀 Getting Started
To test your solution, you can run your script in the browser console or using Node.js:
```javascript
let number = 5; 

// Your code logic here...
