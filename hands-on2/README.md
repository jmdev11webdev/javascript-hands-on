## 🟡 Challenge 2 — Show / Hide Password  
**Difficulty:** Easy → Medium  

### Focus
- Input types  
- Conditional statements  
- Event handling  

### Description
Create a password input field with a button that allows the user to toggle the visibility of the password. The button text should update based on whether the password is currently visible or hidden.

### Requirements
- A password input field (`type="password"`)
- A button to toggle password visibility
- The button label must switch between:
  - **Show password**
  - **Hide password**

### Expected Behavior
- When the password is hidden, clicking the button reveals the password
- When the password is visible, clicking the button hides it again
- The button text always reflects the current state

### Brainstorm Questions
- Which input attribute controls password visibility?
- How can you determine the current visibility state?
- What conditional logic is needed to switch between states?
